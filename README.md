A)From the plot, we can see that the mean glucose value for the sample (128.08) is slightly lower than the population mean glucose value (120.89). However, the maximum glucose value for the sample (198) is higher than the population's maximum glucose value (199).



B)From the plot, we can see that the BMI distribution for the sample is slightly shifted towards higher values compared to the population. The 98th percentile BMI value for the sample (50.542) is also higher than the population's 98th percentile BMI value (45.274).



C) From the plots, we can see that the distributions of the bootstrap mean, standard deviations and 95th percentiles are roughly normal and centered around the population statistics. The population mean, standard deviation, and 95th percentile of blood pressure (69.105, 19.356, and 88) are all within the range of the bootstrap statistics, indicating that the bootstrap samples provide a good estimate of the population statistics.
